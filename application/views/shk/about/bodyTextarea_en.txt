[TITLE3]Who are we[/TITLE3]
We are group of people (just a couple), who enjoy to create new stuff. Well, there is not a lot of creating stuff, it's more like thinking trough stuff, but we would like to make the best stuf into the real thing. We are mostly interested in games and in everything associated with them (playing, commenting, developing). We are just starting to develop games, but that means it's gonna be much more fun to watch us doing so and watch our progress. Since we are learning new things we want to pass some knowlage to you guys by writing a blog. And don't worry that it's gonna be as boring as this 'article'. This is so sh$*%y, because I'm not in the mood.
[TITLE3]About the page[/TITLE3]
Purpose of this page is some sort of presentation for us and our projects. We are gonna try to inform you about the progress and issues we encountre. So it's possible to learn something and we give you the view of things as amateurs. We choose to brief you in the form of blogs, but it does not mean, that we are not gonna use also video and images in our blogs, or other portals. Anyway, we would like to let you know about new post also by social media. So follow us everywhere because that's what cool kids do nowadays.
